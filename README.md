# openmrs-module-locationbasedaccess
Some implementations want to register users and patients in certain locations. Then access them based on the location that some one has logged in. That way, if some one is logged in a certain location, they should see only those encounters, observations, and patients registered in that location. But the System Developer account should be able to see patients in all locations.
